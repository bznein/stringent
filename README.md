# Stringent

## A minimal, header-only collection of string functions

### Not tested, not guaranteed!

Welcome to **stringent**!
Note: This is not a library, it is just a personal project, a collection of functions
that I felt the need for and I have implemented. They are here, public, so that if someone else
needs them, he/she can copy, modify, distribute them however he/she likes!

Maybe one day I will organize it better, for now it is just a single header file with all the definitions ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
